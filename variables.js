// Assigning variables values

let firstName = "David";
let lastName = "Tucker";
let numYearsEmployment = 6;
let dateBirth = new Date("January 1, 1982");

// Changing a variable created with let
numYearsEmployment = 7;  // OK

// Using const to create a constant
const title = "VP of Engineering";
title = "CTO"; // NOT OK. This would cause an error.

// "Var" exists but don't use it
